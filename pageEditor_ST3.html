        <section>
          <h2 id="feedback">Feedback Page</h2>
          <h3>Technical Description</h3>
          <h4>HTML</h4>
          <p>
            In the Feedback Page implementation I use class "input-group" to get
            the user input for name,Email and Mobile-Number. I added some place
            holders to enhance readabilty and required-title for show some
            custom instruction to show to user. When it comes to exception
            handling which user enters some wrong credentials it shows Custom
            Error message with class="error". I added "fieldset" and "Label"
            attribute to other sections to get the user input. Program is
            enhanced with radio button for get specific answers from user and I
            added the default select as yes for both radio buttons. When it
            comes to text area field as CW expected to get the word count
            respectively when user enters. To enhanced the efficiency of the
            backend server I put maxlenth attribute as 500 which user can't type
            more.Yes for now we are not using any BackEnd server. Next we have
            the selection which user can select any options. For get the rating
            from the user I added some emojis and put some text allign with it
            when emoji is not readable user can read the text. When it comes to
            getting files from user I add type="file" for that. When it comes to
            getting the datetime-local I added default selected value as CW
            specified. I added some user agreement as we taking some personal
            details from the user. Now at the end I put Java Script I have to
            use some Java Script especially for getting the word count from
            user. Here I put id = "textarea" in the relavent text area fields.
            Other HTML attributes are go with "header" and "footer" refer
            <a href="pageEditor_ST2.html">pageEditor_ST2.html</a>
          </p>
          <h4>CSS</h4>
          <p>
            In the Feedback Page CSS I added video in the background video it's
            fixed to the page and it's covers entire page. I added container box
            which all the elements go in that box and I can change it
            characteristic by it, when opening the page I added some transition
            which user can see the fadein. When user in some text field I use
            focus to that It may helps to user to see what box is selected.
            Fieldset and the Label is used to keep space between the relavent
            fields. I added specific input for radio button which I can change
            it. When it comes to button I put "Send" and "Reset" Send button
            deosn't have any functionality because it doesn't link to any
            BackEnd server. Error handling is one of keyfeature when it comes to
            forms. Here I use some CSS styling to it, Yes we can do it by Java
            Script too but HTML 5 is advanced when it implement by CSS there is
            a some difficulties. I hope to tell more about it in the challenges
          </p>
          <h4>Java Script</h4>
          <p>
            For get the word count for textfields I use Java Script thiis I used
            as internal Script I used word length to count the words and it
            shows the word count under the relavent text fields
          </p>
          <h3>Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            Accessibility is one of key features in the page. I use some
            accessibility for some screen readers especially when it comes to
            website it self there are some built in Accessibility featues like
            reading the page. Users can change the tab by header and footer
            which provide links to relavent web pages accordingly. You can refer
            it by <a href="pageEditor_ST2.html">pageEditor_ST2.html</a>
          </p>

          <h3>Link to the validation page</h3>
          <!-- Update the path to link the Page Editor with the splash page -->
          <p><a href="validation_ST3.html#feedback">Click here</a></p>

          <h3>Link to the page</h3>
          <p><a href="feedback.html">Click here</a></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 id="team">Team Page</h2>
          <h3>Technical Description</h3>
          <h4>HTML</h4>
          <p>
            In the Team page I added some background video for better visual
            experience. I use row and columns for keep the card respectively
            accordingly to the screen and centered it. Every card have class
            called row and column which describes it placement. I used some
            class hover-text for when cursor moves there hover the additional
            detais to each member in here there is a contribution to there tasks
            in web page. I add some transition to enhance user experience when
            cursor moves the card text hover from the bottom.
          </p>
          <h4>CSS</h4>
          <p>
            I use styling to make the program more visually engaging with the
            user. This wrapper class is used for keep the content within the
            headr and footer. Section is used to adjust the box elements in the
            page. h1 is the main topic for each members name row and columns is
            used to keep gap between each cards. I used some hovering effect to
            each card as well. Here it goes as when user moves background color
            is changed to #ffcc00. I used this color from our color pallete.
          </p>
          <h3>Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            Team Page is rich accessibility featues such as when user moves
            cursor it automatically shows the contribution of each memeber this
            helps to user to identify the relavant contribution of each members.
            Other Accessibility featues are describes same as the Feedback page
            whih I mentioned earlier.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
          <h3>Technical Description</h3>
          <h4>HTML</h4>
          <p>
            I gathered information on Smart Planning in Sri Lanka. I put some
            title and background picture for id goes as h1 element as the main
            topic, other sub topic elements are goes with h2 attribute. I used
            some ul to create an undordered list to put some paragraphs. section
            attribute used for the seperate the section between subtopics. Every
            subtopic have some images which relavent to it. In the second topic
            which descibes Smart Driven Transportation I added two images.
          </p>
          <h4>CSS</h4>
          <p>
            In the content page I use white bacground which user can read the
            articles without distrupting. wrapper class works same as I
            mentioned earlier. section class give some gap between the articles.
            container is used to adjust the text area accordingly. Images are
            used to increase more desprective approach to talk about the sub
            topics and I put it as gallery view. For future referece I added
            each image a class which is not essential for now but if we need to
            add more pictures in the page it can be helped and it's easy to
            identify which increse the readabilty of the program. When it comes
            to transition I used it for when opening the tab it comes from
            bottom to up which increase user's visual experience
          </p>
          <h3>Accessibility</h3>
          <p>
            In the content page I added some links which opens other websites
            that I referenced it helps user to read more about the topic if they
            are interested. Other accessibility featues are same as I mentioned
            earlier
          </p>

          <h2 id="challenge">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest challenge I face when implementing the feedback form. In
            the feedback form it is more advance than other pages I created. I
            have to use Java Script to get the word count. While making the
            pages I mostly avoid Java Script. We started Java Script just now
            when creating this webpage which I don't have any experience on that
            I learned it from youtube tutorials and the Linkedin learning. I
            used documentaion to learn it. I learned a lot about Java Script
            from making the Feedback Page
          </p>
          <p>
            Team page has lot of animation with it like when cursor moves it
            should shows the Description of each team member. HTML is pretty
            easy for making Team page I used some tools like Figma to create it.
            When it comes to CSS it's the most challenging part I faced in the
            Team pages. I put some hovering effect where CW specified as it is.
            I learned a lot of CSS attribute from this page
          </p>
          <p>
            Content page is especially based on HTML which has lot of
            Description about my conten topic. I implement this at the last I
            gain a lot of experience from team page and feedback page it helps
            me a lot to make the content page. It's doesn't have any rich CSS
            attributes like I used for Team Page. Where I focused on user's
            readabilty. Here I'm facing some problem some reader's prefer dark
            background when reading some articles. I tried to add in built in
            dark background toggle but it requires more knowledge on CSS.
            Finally I tried to adhere to CW specification and try my best to do
            it as it says
          </p>

          <h2 id="compliance">Compliance</h2>
          <p>
            When developing my pages for Sustainafy, I ensured compliance with
            Janet’s Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) by following ethical, legal, and
            technical guidelines for web publication. This includes adhering to
            GDPR for data protection, implementing WCAG accessibility standards,
            and ensuring that all content is appropriate and non-disruptive to
            the network. By following these regulations, my pages promote
            inclusivity, security, and responsible web usage, aligning with best
            practices for educational and public-facing websites.
